**Steps to apply database changes:**

1.  **Apply the pending migration:**
    *   Open your terminal in the project root.
    *   Run the command: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
    *   This will add the `usersLimit` field to your `Plan` model in the database.

2.  **Update seed data (optional but recommended):**
    *   Open DBeaver and connect to your `dev.db` database.
    *   Go to the `Plan` table.
    *   For each plan, manually set a value for the `usersLimit` column. For example, you might set `5` for "Agence Starter" and `-1` (for unlimited) for "Agence Pro" and "Agence Entreprise".
    *   Remember to commit the changes in DBeaver after updating the data.

After completing these steps, you should be able to add users according to your plan's user limit, and the limit will be displayed on the settings page.
