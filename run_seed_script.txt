**Command to run the seed script:**

Open your terminal in the project root and run:

`npx prisma db seed`

This command will execute the `prisma/seed.ts` file, which is configured to create the three plans ("Agence Starter", "Agence Pro", and "Agence Entreprise") and the ADMIN user.

After running this command, please verify in DBeaver if the `Plan` table now contains the three plans.
