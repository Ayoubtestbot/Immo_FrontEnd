Steps to update ADMIN user's password in the database:

1.  **Generate a bcrypt hash for 'password123':**
    *   Open your terminal.
    *   If you don't have `bcrypt` installed, run: `npm install bcrypt`
    *   Run the following Node.js script to generate the hash:
        ```javascript
        const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
        bcrypt.hash('password123', 10).then(hash => console.log(hash));
        ```
    *   Copy the generated hash from your terminal output. It will look something like `$2a$10$......................................................`.

2.  **Update the user's password in DBeaver:**
    *   Open DBeaver and connect to your `dev.db` database.
    *   In the `Database Navigator` panel, expand your `dev.db` connection, then `Tables`, and double-click on the `User` table.
    *   Find the row for the user with the email `admin@example.com`.
    *   Double-click on the `password` column for this user.
    *   Paste the bcrypt hash you generated in step 1 into this field.
    *   Click the `Save` button (usually a disk icon) in the DBeaver toolbar to save the modifications to your `dev.db` file.

3.  **Try logging in again:**
    *   After updating the password hash in the database, please try logging in as ADMIN again with `admin@example.com` and `password123`.
